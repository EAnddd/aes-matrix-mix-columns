CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindNTL.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "NTL", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "NTL" with any of
  the following names:

    NTLConfig.cmake
    ntl-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "NTL" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "NTL_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "NTL" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
